1. The purpose of this Git repo is to allow me to have space to host my own work  
and to be able to display my portfolio to whomever I would like to see it.

2. My favorite assignment was assignment 2 because I felt like it showed me the power  
of JavaScript and HTML together.

3. I think I have grown in that I now know something about what is one of the largest  
fields of computer science today, a vital piece of knowledge to have.

4. The most important thing I learned was that web dev is fantastically complicated and  
there is no way for anyone to be an expert on all of it. The amount of documentation  
for some of the simplest things we had to do in JavaScript, e.g. with Google Maps,  
is one of the reasons I think this. Another is the sheer size of the CSS library and  
the amount that you can do with it, but also the amount of learning you have to do to  
get it to work for you.

5. How JavaScript implements its objects and what sort of algorithms are at play,  
considering that everything is a hash table.
